screenfetch-c
=============

[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/woodruffw/screenfetch-c/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/woodruffw/screenfetch-c/latest)

## Current Version: 1.4 (release)

screenfetch-c is an attempt to rewrite screenFetch, a popular shell
script that displays system information and an ASCII logo, in the C
language.
Like the original screenFetch, screenfetch-c is meant to be compatible with a number of systems, including *BSD, Solaris, GNU/Linux, OS X, and Windows (via the Cygwin environment).

## Installing screenfetch-c:

### Dependencies:
screenfetch-c only relies on libraries that come on virtually every system.

* On Linux, OpenGL is used to detect the GPU. In most package managers, this is listed as `libgl-dev`.

* On Linux and Solaris, libX11 is required. In most package managers, this is listed as `libX11-dev`.

Installing screenfetch-c is very simple:

```bash
$ git clone https://www.github.com/woodruffw/screenfetch-c.git
$ cd screenfetch-c
$ make
```

If you want to disable colors you can run `make COLORS=0` instead.

_Note:_ For Solaris, `make` *must* be GNU make. If it isn't, use `gmake`. Using regular (Sun) `make` will cause strange errors.

### OS X

screenfetch-c is also available via Homebrew!

To install it, just run the following:

```bash
$ brew install woodruffw/screenfetch-c/screenfetch-c
```

## Removal:
Removing screenfetch-c is just as easy as installing it:

```bash
$ sudo make uninstall
```

If you installed it via Homebrew:

```bash
$ brew rm screenfetch-c
$ brew untap woodruffw/screenfetch-c # optional
```

## Contributing

There are a number of things that still need to be tested or completed in screenfetch-c.

If you think that you can test/fix/improve one or more of them, feel free to fork and issue requests back to me.

In particular, the following things still need to be done:

- Improve error checking and handling.
- Matching screencapture capabilities on Windows with OS X/Linux/BSD/Solaris
- Improve RAM/HDD detection on BSD
- Fix manual mode on Windows
- Improve features on Android
- Improve/replace configuration format and parser
