screenfetch-c
=============

### Current Version: 1.1 Beta (compiled, 99% complete)

screenfetch-c is an attempt to rewrite screenFetch, a popular shell 
script that displays system information and an ASCII logo, in the C 
language.
Like the original screenFetch, screenfetch-c is meant to be compatible with a number of systems, including *BSD, GNU/Linux, OS X, and Windows (via the Cygwin environment).

### Current Status:
screenfetch-c has been extensively tested on Windows 7 (in the Cygwin environment), OS X (10.6 and 10.8), and Linux (see list below).
It has not yet been tested on any BSD distro. Therefore, I currently advise against using screenfetch-c on *BSD, even if it does compile successfully. However, it is up to you.

There are only a few select sections that still require work. They are listed here:
- GPU detection is not implemented on Linux or BSD (appears as "Unknown").
- Distro detection is not 100% complete, although it's close. If screenfetch-c fails to detect a specific distro, try running it with the -D [distro] flag.
- Package detection requires more in-depth testing on OS X (testing for MacPorts/Fink).

### Installing screenfetch-c:

#### Using the provided script (install.sh):
screenfetch-c can be installed very easily via the install.sh script provided in the /scripts directory.

Simply download the script and run it:
```
./install.sh
```

It will fetch all source code (and manpages) required, compile screenfetch, install the manpage, and leave a tidy binary in $HOME. You can then move that binary whereever you please.

_Note_: install.sh will prompt you for your root password in order to install the manpages!

#### Manual compilation:
Alternatively, you could always compile screenfetch-c yourself. It's very easy to do, as 
screenfetch-c has no dependencies outside of the standard and POSIX libraries of each OS.
screenfetch-c is designed to be C99 compliant, although compiling with C90 should work provided
you have the snprintf() function.

```
gcc -std=c99 screenfetch-c.c thread.c -o screenfetch -lpthread
```

Just be sure that screenfetch-c.h is in the same directory, as it contains all of 
screenfetch-c.c's prototypes and macros. If you want to be able to detect DE/WM/WM Theme/GTK information without manual mode, you will also need the scripts (chmoded to executable, of course). They _must_ be stored in the same directory as the screenfetch executable, or it will not be able to utilize them.
You can also choose the install screenfetch-c's manpage, if you wish.

##### Removal:
Removing screenfetch-c is just as easy as installing it.
Simply delete the binary, ~/.screenfetchc (if you used manual mode), and the manpage, which is stored in /usr/share/man/man1/screenfetch.1.gz

If you compiled screenfetch-c manually, the final step may not be required.
